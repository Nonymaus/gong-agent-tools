Re: Postman Licensing
Pricing
Hi Danai - I was CC'd on the message yesterday, we sent over a quote to Insight around midday CST so this is in their court now.

However, this quote is only for the 431 licenses to be renewed, it does not include the additional users from the survey. My question is - would you like to see an option where we include these additional users to significantly reduce the cost per user?
